The Marriage Act stipulates that if either party to an intended marriage is a minor (which, in the context of the Act, includes those under 21 years of age but over the marriageable age), they must obtain the written consent of their father. If the father is deceased or of unsound mind, the mother may provide consent, or a legal guardian if both parents are unavailable.</p><div class="my-6 p-4 bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 text-blue-800 rounded-md" role="alert"><p class="font-bold">Important Note</p><p>Buttons to preview, download, or fill this document are at the bottom of this page.</p></div><h3>Why is it Required?</h3><p>This affidavit serves as a protective measure to ensure that young adults are entering into the lifelong commitment of marriage with the guidance and approval of their guardians. Marriage Registries across Nigeria will strictly demand this document before publishing the banns of marriage or celebrating the union if the age on the birth certificate indicates the applicant is under 21. Without this sworn consent, the Registrar is legally empowered to refuse to proceed with the marriage celebration.</p><h3>Content and Structure</h3><p>The affidavit is sworn by the parent or guardian, not the person getting married. The deponent (parent) must state their full name, address, and their relationship to the prospective bride or groom. The document must explicitly state the name of the child and the name of the person the child intends to marry. The crucial clause is the unequivocal statement that the parent consents to the union freely and without coercion. This removes any legal barriers to the marriage regarding age restrictions.</p><h3>Customary vs. Statutory Context</h3><p>While primarily a requirement for Statutory Marriage (Court Wedding), a similar form of consent is often required in Customary Marriages, where parental blessing is the cornerstone of the union's validity. However, this specific affidavit is usually drafted to satisfy the requirements of the Federal Marriage Registry or local government registries to obtain a Marriage Certificate. It protects the registry from future litigation claiming the marriage was conducted without necessary parental authorization.</p></div><div class="my-6"></div></div><div class="mt-8 pt-6 border-t"><div class="mb-6"></div><div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4"><a href="https://gitut.com/us/go-to-site/internal-form/?redirect=%2Fus%2Fview%2Faffidavit-of-consent-to-marriage-parental-in-nigeria-ng%2F&name=Document%20Preview" class="bg-red-600 text-white font-bold py-3 px-8 rounded-lg hover:bg-red-700 text-center">Document Preview</a><a href="https://gitut.com/us/go-to-site/internal-form/?redirect=%2Fus%2Fpublic-form%2Faffidavit-of-consent-to-marriage-parental-in-nigeria-ng%2F&name=Fill%2FDownload" class="bg-green-600 text-white font-bold py-3 px-8 rounded-lg hover:bg-green-700 text-center">Fill/Download</a></div></div></div><aside class="md:col-span-1 space-y-6"><div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg border sticky top-24"><h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-3 text-gray-800">Related Services</h3><div class="space-y-3"><a href="https://gitut.com/us/doc/affidavit-of-bachelorhood-in-nigeria-ng/" class="w-full text-right block p-3 bg-gray-50 rounded-md border hover:border-green-400 hover:bg-green-50 transition-all"><p class="font-semibold text-gray-900">Download Form Affidavit of Bachelorhood in Nigeria</p><div class="mt-1 prose prose-sm max-w-none line-clamp-2 compact-prose"><p>An Affidavit of Bachelorhood is a formal, sworn legal declaration made by a male individual before a Commissioner for Oaths or a Notary Public, attesting to the fact that he has never been married and is currently free from any marital obligations. In the Nigerian legal context, this document serves as a critical proof of status, particularly for men who intend to contract a marriage, whether under the Marriage Act (Statutory Marriage) or under Native Law and Custom. It effectively declares to the world and relevant authorities that the deponent is a bachelor and possesses the legal capacity to enter into a new matrimonial union without committing the crime of bigamy.</p><h3>Purpose and Utility</h3><p>The primary use of this affidavit is to satisfy the requirements of marriage registries. When a man applies to wed, the registry must verify that there are no existing valid marriages that would render the new union void. Furthermore, this document is frequently requested by embassies and foreign consulates when a Nigerian man intends to marry a foreign national abroad. In such cases, the Affidavit of Bachelorhood serves as a 'Certificate of No Impediment,' proving that the man is single in his home country.</p><h3>Key Contents of the Affidavit</h3><p>To be valid, the affidavit must contain specific factual details. First, it must state the full name, age, and address of the deponent. It must explicitly state that the individual has never participated in any form of marriage ceremony, be it religious, customary, or civil. If the affidavit is being sworn for the purpose of a specific upcoming marriage, the name of the intended spouse is often included to provide context. Finally, it must conclude with the statutory declaration under the Oaths Act, affirming that the information provided is true to the best of the deponent's knowledge.</p><h3>Legal Implications</h3><p>Swearing to a false Affidavit of Bachelorhood is a serious offense under Nigerian law, categorized as perjury. If a man is found to have an existing subsisting marriage while swearing he is a bachelor, he may face criminal prosecution and imprisonment. Additionally, any marriage contracted based on this false declaration would be considered void ab initio (invalid from the start). Therefore, this document is not merely a formality but a binding legal assertion of one's civil status.</p></div></a><a href="https://gitut.com/us/doc/affidavit-of-spinsterhood-in-nigeria-ng/" class="w-full text-right block p-3 bg-gray-50 rounded-md border hover:border-green-400 hover:bg-green-50 transition-all"><p class="font-semibold text-gray-900">Download Form Affidavit of Spinsterhood in Nigeria</p><div class="mt-1 prose prose-sm max-w-none line-clamp-2 compact-prose"><p>The Affidavit of Spinsterhood is a vital legal document used in Nigeria by a female declarant to formally attest to her single status. It is a sworn statement made before a judicial officer, such as a Commissioner for Oaths or a Notary Public, confirming that the woman has never been married under Statutory Law, Customary Law, or Islamic Law, and is therefore free to enter into a valid marriage contract. This document is the female equivalent of the Affidavit of Bachelorhood and holds significant weight in civil and administrative procedures concerning marriage and immigration.</p><h3>Why is this Affidavit Necessary?</h3><p>The primary necessity for an Affidavit of Spinsterhood arises during the marriage registration process. The Marriage Registry requires proof that a bride-to-be is not currently bound by an existing marriage, thereby preventing the legal complications of bigamy or polyandry (which is not recognized in Nigeria). Beyond local marriage registration, this affidavit is extensively used for international travel and visa applications. When a Nigerian woman intends to marry a foreign national or relocate to join a fiancé abroad, the host country's immigration authorities usually require a sworn affidavit of single status, often authenticated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to issue a fiancé visa or a marriage license.</p><h3>Structure and Content</h3><p>A standard Affidavit of Spinsterhood must be meticulously drafted. It begins with the personal details of the deponent (the woman), including her full name, religion, nationality, and residential address. The core of the document is the explicit declaration that she is a 'Spinster' and has never gone through any form of marriage ceremony with any man. If the affidavit is preparatory to a specific wedding, the name of the intended groom is usually mentioned to link the document to the specific event. It concludes with a statement of truth in compliance with the Oaths Act of 1990.</p><h3>Legal Validity and Consequences</h3><p>Once sworn and signed by the Commissioner for Oaths, this document becomes a binding record. It is important to note that 'Spinsterhood' in this legal context simply means a woman who has never been married; it is distinct from being a divorcee or a widow. If a woman has been married before, she would instead need a Decree Absolute (for divorce) or a Death Certificate (for widowhood). Falsifying information on this affidavit constitutes perjury, a criminal offense punishable under the Criminal Code of Nigeria.</p></div></a><a href="https://gitut.com/us/doc/affidavit-of-declaration-of-marriage-in-nigeria-ng/" class="w-full text-right block p-3 bg-gray-50 rounded-md border hover:border-green-400 hover:bg-green-50 transition-all"><p class="font-semibold text-gray-900">Download Form Affidavit of Declaration of Marriage in Nigeria</p><div class="mt-1 prose prose-sm max-w-none line-clamp-2 compact-prose"><p>An Affidavit of Declaration of Marriage is a legal instrument used to formally affirm the existence of a marriage between two individuals. In Nigeria, this document is particularly significant for couples who may have lost their original marriage certificate or for those whose marriage was conducted under Native Law and Custom and was not immediately registered with a government designated registry. It acts as a sworn confirmation of the matrimonial union and is widely accepted as secondary evidence of marriage in the absence of the primary certificate.</p><h3>When is this Affidavit Used?</h3><p>There are several scenarios where this declaration becomes necessary. The most common is for official record-keeping updates. For instance, a woman wishing to change her surname on her bank account, driver's license, or international passport to that of her husband will require proof of marriage. If the couple contracted a customary marriage (traditional wedding), they might not have received a certificate that is recognized by corporate institutions or embassies. In this case, the Affidavit of Declaration of Marriage serves to bridge that gap. It is also used during visa applications to prove family ties.</p><h3>Difference from Marriage Certificate</h3><p>It is important to distinguish this affidavit from a Statutory Marriage Certificate issued by a Federal Marriage Registry (like Ikoyi Registry). A Registry certificate is the highest form of proof. However, the Affidavit of Declaration of Marriage is a valid attestation of facts used to support the claim of marriage. In many official processes, this affidavit must be accompanied by photos of the wedding ceremony or a letter from the church/mosque/traditional ruler to add weight to the claim.</p><h3>Key Information Required</h3><p>The content of the affidavit must include the names of both spouses, the date the marriage took place, and the venue of the marriage (e.g., the specific church, mosque, or the family compound where traditional rites were performed). It must clearly state that the couple has been living together happily as husband and wife since the date of the marriage. By swearing to this affidavit, the deponent accepts legal liability for the truthfulness of the marriage claim.</p></div></a><a href="https://gitut.com/us/doc/affidavit-of-separation-in-nigeria-ng/" class="w-full text-right block p-3 bg-gray-50 rounded-md border hover:border-green-400 hover:bg-green-50 transition-all"><p class="font-semibold text-gray-900">Download Form Affidavit of Separation in Nigeria</p><div class="mt-1 prose prose-sm max-w-none line-clamp-2 compact-prose"><p>An Affidavit of Separation is a formal sworn statement used by a spouse to declare that they are living apart from their husband or wife. It is important to note that under the Matrimonial Causes Act of Nigeria, this affidavit does not dissolve a statutory marriage; only a court-issued Decree Absolute can legally end a statutory marriage. However, this affidavit serves as a crucial evidentiary document to prove the factual status of the relationship at a given point in time.</p><h3>Purpose and Application</h3><p>This affidavit is frequently utilized in situations where a couple has separated but has not yet concluded—or perhaps even started—formal divorce proceedings. It serves several practical purposes: it can be used to separate financial liability, ensuring that one spouse is not held responsible for debts incurred by the other after the separation date. It is also used in child custody matters to establish the timeline of the household breakup. Furthermore, it may be required by government agencies or employers when updating next-of-kin records or changing tax statuses that are dependent on cohabitation.</p><h3>Establishing Grounds for Divorce</h3><p>In the context of Nigerian divorce law, one of the facts proving that a marriage has broken down irretrievably is that the parties have lived apart for a continuous period of at least two years (with the respondent's consent) or three years (without consent). An Affidavit of Separation sworn at the beginning of this period can serve as compelling evidence to specific dates when the couple ceased living as 'husband and wife,' thereby helping to establish the timeline required for a future divorce petition.</p><h3>Content Requirements</h3><p>The document must clearly state the names of the parties, the date and place of the marriage, and the specific date since which the couple has been living apart. It typically includes a clause stating that the separation is due to irreconcilable differences or other valid reasons. By swearing to this affidavit, the deponent creates a public record of the separation, which brings clarity to the ambiguous period between a breakup and a legal divorce.</p></div></a><a href="https://gitut.com/us/doc/affidavit-of-non-objection-to-marriage-in-nigeria-ng/" class="w-full text-right block p-3 bg-gray-50 rounded-md border hover:border-green-400 hover:bg-green-50 transition-all"><p class="font-semibold text-gray-900">Download Form Affidavit of Non-Objection to Marriage in Nigeria</p><div class="mt-1 prose prose-sm max-w-none line-clamp-2 compact-prose"><p>The Affidavit of Non-Objection to Marriage is a formal declaration made by a parent, guardian, or senior family member stating that they have no opposition to a proposed union involving their relative. While similar to the 'Parental Consent' affidavit, this document is distinct in its application and is most frequently requested in the context of international marriages or visa applications where a Nigerian citizen is marrying a foreign national.</p><h3>International and Diplomatic Use</h3><p>Many foreign embassies and consulates (such as those of Schengen countries, the UK, or the US) require proof that the family of the Nigerian applicant is aware of and approves of the marriage. This is partly to prevent sham marriages and partly to satisfy cultural protocols that are respected in international family law. For example, if a Nigerian is applying for a fiancé visa to move to another country, the immigration officers there may ask for an Affidavit of Non-Objection from the Nigerian family to ensure the relationship is bona fide and recognized by the community.</p><h3>Cultural Significance</h3><p>In the Nigerian context, marriage is often viewed as a union between families, not just individuals. This affidavit formalizes the family's blessing. It essentially states, 'We know this person is marrying X, and we have no problem with it.' This can be crucial if the person marrying is of full legal age (over 21) and technically doesn't need 'consent' under the Marriage Act, but still requires 'non-objection' for administrative or cultural proof to third parties.</p><h3>Document Details</h3><p>The deponent (usually the father, mother, or head of the family) will swear that they are related to the bride/groom, that they are aware of the intended marriage to the specific spouse, and that they have no objection to the union.
