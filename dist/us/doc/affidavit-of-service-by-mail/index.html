In many Nigerian cultures, the payment of the Bride Price (Dowry) creates the marriage, and the *return* of that Bride Price is the act that legally and culturally ends it. This affidavit is sworn to confirm that this specific transaction has taken place.</p><h3>Significance</h3><p>Without the return of the bride price, some cultures (and courts interpreting customary law) still consider the couple married, regardless of how long they have lived apart. This has implications for the paternity of children born to the woman subsequently (they might be claimed by the former husband) and for inheritance. This affidavit is the proof needed to sever those ties completely.</p><h3>Usage</h3><p>It is sworn by the husband (who received the refund) or the wife's family representative (who paid the refund). It states clearly that the sum was returned and accepted on a specific date, thereby dissolving the union. It is used in customary courts or presented to marriage registries when one party seeks to contract a new statutory marriage.</p></div> </a><a href="https://gitut.com/us/doc/affidavit-of-dissolution-of-customary-marriage-in-nigeria-ng/" class="w-full text-right block p-3 bg-gray-50 rounded-md border hover:border-green-400 hover:bg-green-50 transition-all"> <p class="font-semibold text-gray-900">Download Form Affidavit of Dissolution of Customary Marriage in Nigeria</p> <div class="mt-1 prose prose-sm max-w-none line-clamp-2 compact-prose"><p>The Affidavit of Dissolution of Customary Marriage is the legal documentation affirming that a marriage contracted under Native Law and Custom has ended. Unlike Statutory Marriages, which require a High Court decree to dissolve, Customary Marriages are dissolved through traditional processes (often involving the return of bride price). This affidavit serves as the written evidence that those traditional processes have been concluded.</p><h3>Why it is Needed</h3><p>Since customary courts are not present in every community and some divorces happen amicably within family meetings, there is often no 'Divorce Certificate' issued by a judge. However, if a woman wants to remarry (especially under the Marriage Act), she must prove she is free from the previous union. This affidavit is accepted by the Marriage Registry as proof of divorce. It is also used to change names on official documents and to settle custody or property matters.</p><h3>Content</h3><p>The affidavit must state the names of the former couple, the date and place of the original marriage, and the fact that the marriage has been dissolved in accordance with the custom of the area (e.g., by the return of dowry). It confirms that the deponent is now a free person, legally capable of entering a new marriage.</p></div> </a><a href="https://gitut.com/us/doc/affidavit-of-living-spouses-in-nigeria-ng/" class="w-full text-right block p-3 bg-gray-50 rounded-md border hover:border-green-400 hover:bg-green-50 transition-all"> <p class="font-semibold text-gray-900">Download Form Affidavit of Living Spouses in Nigeria</p> <div class="mt-1 prose prose-sm max-w-none line-clamp-2 compact-prose"><p>The Affidavit of Living Spouses is a declaration used primarily to clarify family lineage and inheritance rights in the context of polygamous settings, which are common under Customary and Islamic Law in Nigeria. However, it is also used in monogamous contexts to verify current marital status for record-keeping. The document details the number and identity of the spouses currently married to the deponent.</p><h3>Inheritance and Pension</h3><p>When a person (usually a man in a polygamous union) dies or retires, distributing benefits or the estate can be complex. Pension Fund Administrators and Probate Registries need to know exactly how many wives are legally recognized to calculate portions of the estate. This affidavit, sworn by the husband while alive (or by the wives/eldest son after death), lists the validly married spouses.</p><h3>Proof of Status</h3><p>It acts as a safeguard against fraudulent claims by individuals pretending to be spouses after a wealthy individual passes away. By listing the spouses on oath, the deponent solidifies the family structure in the eyes of the law. It must list the full names of the spouse(s) and potentially the dates of marriage.</p></div> </a><a href="https://gitut.com/us/doc/affidavit-of-maintenance-of-children-in-nigeria-ng/" class="w-full text-right block p-3 bg-gray-50 rounded-md border hover:border-green-400 hover:bg-green-50 transition-all"> <p class="font-semibold text-gray-900">Download Form Affidavit of Maintenance of Children in Nigeria</p> <div class="mt-1 prose prose-sm max-w-none line-clamp-2 compact-prose"><p>The Affidavit of Maintenance of Children is a sworn statement by a parent (usually the father, though applicable to any provider) confirming that they are financially responsible for the upkeep of specific children. This document is widely used in immigration, family court, and educational contexts. It serves as a binding promise and proof of the financial relationship between the parent and the dependents.</p><h3>Visa and Immigration</h3><p>One of the most common uses is for visa applications (e.g., student visas for children studying abroad). Embassies require proof that the sponsor has not only the funds but also the legal obligation to support the applicant. This affidavit, usually accompanied by bank statements, satisfies the 'Sponsorship' requirement. It assures the host country that the child will not become a public charge.</p><h3>Family Law and Separation</h3><p>In cases of separation where there is no formal court order for child support yet, a father may swear this affidavit to prove to a school or hospital that he is the liable party for bills. It can also be used by a mother to document that the father has agreed to pay a certain amount, serving as evidence if the matter later goes to court.</p><h3>Content</h3><p>The affidavit lists the names and ages of the children. The deponent states that they are the parent/sponsor and that they undertake to provide for the feeding, clothing, accommodation, and education of the children. It is a declaration of financial capacity and intent.</p></div> </a> </div> </div> <div class="sticky top-24"></div> </aside> </div> </main> <footer class="bg-white border-t mt-auto"> <div class="container mx-auto px-4 py-8 flex flex-col items-center gap-4"> <nav class="flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-x-6 gap-y-2 text-gray-600"><a href="https://gitut.com/us/services/" class="hover:text-green-600 hover:underline">Services List</a></nav> <div class="flex justify-center gap-6 my-4"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61585635470099" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="w-6 h-6 text-gray-500 hover:text-green-600 transition-colors"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" height="24" width="24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M400 32H48A48 48 0 0 0 0 80v352a48 48 0 0 0 48 48h137.25V327.69h-63V256h63v-54.64c0-62.15 37-96.48 93.67-96.48 27.14 0 55.52 4.84 55.52 4.84v61h-31.27c-30.81 0-40.43 19.12-40.43 38.73V256h68.75l-11 71.69h-57.75V480H400a48 48 0 0 0 48-48V80a48 48 0 0 0-48-48z"></path></svg></a></div> <p class="text-center text-gray-500 text-sm">&copy; 2025 Gitut USA.
